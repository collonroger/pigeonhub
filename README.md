99 nights in the forest script

Main script:
```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collonroger/pigeonhub/refs/heads/main/99nights.lua"))()```

Autofarm Diamonds script:
```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collonroger/pigeonhub/refs/heads/main/autofarmdiamonds.lua"))()```

Just wait if it makes you serverhop the same server each time. This will be fixed in the future
